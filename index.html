## Lightning Talk (Title TBA)

## Zach is Very Smart

Why a talk about how smart I am?

The community needs to appreciate how smart I am.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

It's important.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Why a lightning talk then?

That's all the time we'll need.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

The Evidence:

- Very wrinkly brain
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- I will convince you of a non-intuitive result
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

All types should be regular...

... by default.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- This is not the smart part yet.  Calm down. -->

----

The "by default" is really important.

Think of `unique_ptr`!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Let's look at a loop:

```c++
for (auto x : values) {
  auto a = function_of(x);
  if (a != x) // regular
    use(a);
}
```

----

Now let's unroll it, doing two iterations per loop:

----

```c++
for (auto [x, y] : pairs_of(values)) {
  auto a = function_of(x);
  if (a != x) // regular
    use(a);
  auto b = function_of(y);
  if (b != y) // still regular
    use(b);
}
```

----

Note that unrolling by 2x is arbitrary.  We could have unrolled by 3x, 4x, or
whatever.

----

Given that, how often have you needed to know when `a == b` in a single loop
iteration?  Does that even make sense?  Those two objects are only in scope
due to an arbitrary unrolling.  In 1x "unrolling", they don't even exist at
the same time!

----

`a` is still regular, and so are `b`, `x`, and `y`.

----

Regularity has nothing to do with comparing objects `a` and `b`.  They are not
comparable, *not because they are non-regular*, but because *they do not exist
at the same time*.  If they seem to be around because of loop unrolling, it is
because we have lost the thread of what's really going on -- looping.

----

The arbitrariness of the unrolling factor is important.  If you unroll 2x,
pairs of values exist at the same time.  For 4x, four values do.  So, when is
it okay to compare values from iteration N and N+m?  This is difficult to
reason about.  Regularity is all about making code easier to reason about.

<!-- Smart?  Hmph!  Yeah. -->

----

```c++
std::simd<double> s1 = { /* ... */ };
std::simd<double> s2 = { /* ... */ };
s1 *= s2;
```

----

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < num_elements(s1); ++i) {
  auto & x = get_element(s1, i);
  auto y = get_element(s2, i);
  x *= y;
}
```

----

This is unrolled using an implementation-defined unrolling factor, which may
or may not be the equal to the number of elements in `s1`.

----

This is why `std::simd` is not regular.  Comparing the nth element of `s1`
with the nth element of `s2` makes sense, because they exist at the same time.

----

Using the results of those comparisons together at the same time makes no
sense, because those results *do not* exist a the same time.  They just appear
to, because of the unrolling inherent in `std::simd`.

----

Making `std::simd` regular would be doing a reduction on the results of the
elementwise comparison operations.  Those are each fine, but using them in a
combined operation makes no sense.

----

<!-- Genius?  Well, ok, I guess so.

For the video, someone just said "that's briliant; you're a genius".

It may be hard to hear on the recording.

If you heard someone saying "no one said that", "that's an empty chair", *bad
audio*. -->

Three final things.

----

I'm being a jackass on purpose.

<!-- Note that I made myself the butt of the joke.  That was super-gracious of
me.  If I made someone else the butt of the joke, what kind of graceless ass
would that make me? -->

----

Rigorous argument is important.

<!-- There are many ways to make your case.

Hopefully you agree that I didn't use any fallacious arguments; I try not to.

One of the most common fallacies is ad hominem -- attacking the person making
an argument, in an attempt to weaken their argument.

If I had done so, I would have weakened my argument, not strengthened it,
perhaps to the point of invalidity.

Keep that in mind for the next, oh, ... exactly five minutes. -->
